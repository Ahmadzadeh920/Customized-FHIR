# Farazan_Parvari_Project
 Launched : December 2022
 
Aydoctor company is working in the medial field creating web service for Medical record. I developed the customized FHIR system for this company to record all medical factors related to users. 
 
# Why this application is formed :
Lack of a comprehensive and coordinated system to monitor the health of people in the community
Lack of regular and coordinated communication between prescribed drugs
Doctors not having access to the patient's medical record 
Available alternatives:
  FHIR  (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)

# Value proposition:
•	The purpose of this program is to prevent the occurrence of medical disorders
•	 Creating a coherent medical system for people in the community
•	A comprehensive system to monitor the performance of doctors
•	A comprehensive system for recording the health status of the community 

# Reqiurements:
•	HTML/CSS/Bootstrap template
•	Python/ Django/REST Framework
•	Javascript/Jquery/
